The tidy data set has 68 columns:
1- Subject which shows how has performed the test. Each number represents a person.
2- Activity shows which activity was the source of the data. for example the subject was laying at the time of capturing the 
samples of was walking.
3- The rest of the columns show the average accelaration value for the subject-activity group. For example the 3rd column 
(tBodyAcc.mean...X) shows the average body acceleration for the subject 1 when Laying was 0.2215982 and the X and the end of
the name of the column shows the acceleration axis. This values are the diffenece between g and the device acceleration value.
some columns show the gravity accelarationi which have the Gravity in their name and show the device accelerationi gravity.
some column have Gyro in their name which show the Gyro value for the subject.
